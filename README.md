## CSV Data Display App
This project is a Next.js application that displays cards containing ideas, emotions, and categories fetched from a CSV file. It utilizes React hooks such as useState and useEffect for managing state and handling side effects. The app allows users to search for cards by emotion or category, with a toggleable search bar for enhanced user experience.

## Features
Dynamic Card Display: Cards are dynamically displayed based on fetched data, allowing users to explore various ideas and associated emotions.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific cards by entering keywords related to emotions or categories.
Random Card Rotation: When no search term is provided, the app periodically rotates through random sets of cards, adding an element of surprise and discovery.

## Technologies Used
React: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
PapaParse: Used for parsing CSV data into a structured format, enabling easy manipulation and display of card information.
React Icons: Provides icons for search functionality, enhancing the app's visual appeal.
